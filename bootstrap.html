  <h1>All about Tennis</h1>
  <p>Intersting facts that you probably didn't know about the game of tennis!</p>

      <h3>Fun Fact #1</h3>
      <p>Today, we see tennis players using a racket to hit the ball, but this was not always the case. The game was initially played with bare hands, and players used to hit the ball with their palms. This was known as “jeu de paume” or “game of the palm” in French. It wasn’t until the 16th century that rackets were introduced, and the game evolved to what we know today.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Fun Fact #2</h3>
      <p>In 2010, John Isner and Nicolas Mahut played the longest tennis match in history at Wimbledon. The match lasted for 11 hours and 5 minutes, spread over three days, with the final score being 6-4, 3-6, 6-7, 7-6, and 70-68. The match was so long that the scoreboard ran out of space for the score and had to be manually changed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Fun Fact #3</h3>        
      <p>Before 1972, tennis balls were predominantly white, making them hard to see on a tennis court. The yellow ball was introduced to improve visibility for players and spectators. However, white balls are still used in some tournaments, such as Wimbledon.</p>

            <p>A 13-year-old has competed at Wimbledon! In 1907, Austrian tennis player Mita Klima became the youngest player to have ever played at Wimbledon. She was 13 years old when she participated in the prestigious tournament. Unfortunately, she lost in the first round. However, participating in such a prestigious tournament at just 13 years old is a phenomenal achievement.</p>
